-----------------ON TO DATA MANIPULATION
-----Primay Key is a constraint
/*Datatypes in oracle sql;
number, varchar, varchar2,timestamps, blob(binary large object), clob(character large object), and more

CONSTRAINTS: they are restrictions on datat that can be entered into a column.
NOT NULL- ensures the record has a value in this column
UNIQUE- ensures that any two records will not have the same value for this column
PRIMARY KEY-it represents the official identifier for the record
                      ----PK is a combination of UNIQUE and NOT NULL
FOREIGN KEY-is a reference pointer to another table's record 

------example syntax for PK: Primary KEY (refkey from THIS table)
------example syntax for FK: FOREIGN KEY (reference_attribute_from_this_table)
                                                REFERENCES other_table (PK_from_other_table
CHECK- creates an additional custom condition 
-------example syntax: CONSTRAINTS constraint_name_CHECK(column_name >15);
(some databases have DEFAULT constraint)

-----How to look at a table's structure and datatype

--------DDL: DROP a table

------DDL: ALTER a table
ALTER TABLE pokemon ADD pokemon_secondtype VARCHAR2(25);
------DDL Truncate
/*not going to do an example BUT truncate deletes all entries into a table
while keeping the table structure intact. DROP is like throwing a cup of water into the trash
where TRUNCATE is like pouring out the fwater while keeping the cup. (deletes all rows, saves the columns)
